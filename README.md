# Applied-Data-Science-24
Course materials for PHYS247-Introduction to Applied Data Science (University of California, Riverside)

## Session 1: Python Installation & Basics
We introduced Python programming and how to get started using Anaconda, VSCode, and Google Colab. Topics covered include variables, data types, basic math operations, and string manipulations.

ðŸ“Œ **Resources**:
- [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/index.html)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Python Crash Course (~10 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWjsdhR3z3c)
- [Full Python Course (~6 hrs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)

## Session 2: Data Structures & Control Flow
We explored essential Python data structures including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Control flow mechanisms such as `if`, `else`, `for`, and `while` loops were introduced for basic decision-making and iteration.

ðŸ“Œ **Topics**:
- Mutable vs immutable types
- Indexing & slicing
- Loops & conditional statements
- `break` / `continue`

## Session 3: Functions & Numpy
This session covered user-defined functions, scope, return values, and basic error handling. We also introduced NumPy for efficient numerical computation, including arrays, array operations, and broadcasting.

ðŸ“Œ **Topics**:
- Function definition, arguments, return values
- Built-in vs custom functions
- NumPy arrays & operations
- Vectorized math with NumPy
